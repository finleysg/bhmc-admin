Definition of Done

A task is not completed until:

1. All tests pass.
2. No linting errors (ESLint must return zero errors; use --max-warnings 0).
3. Prettier format has been run on all files that have been touched.
4. No dev processes have been left running unless you have been explicitly asked to leave a dev server running.
