PRD 1.1 DONE: MemberScoresService created
- File: apps/api/src/reports/member-scores.service.ts
- Exports getPlayerScoresExcel(playerId, season, courseIds?, scoreType)
- Queries via Drizzle, sorts by course/date, generates Gross/Net sheets
- Uses excel.utils.ts patterns from ReportsService

PRD 1.2+1.3 DONE: MemberReportsController + module registration
- Created: apps/api/src/reports/member-reports.controller.ts
- GET reports/member/scores/:season/export (no @Admin)
- Query params: courseIds (comma-sep), scoreType (default 'both')
- Returns xlsx with Content-Disposition: my-scores-{season}.xlsx
- Used string param + cast for ScoreType to avoid decorator metadata issue
- Updated reports.module.ts with controller + service registration
