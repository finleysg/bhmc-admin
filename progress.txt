PRD #1: Add getAvailableSpots method to registration service
- Added countSlotsByEventAndStatus/countSlotsByEvent to RegistrationRepository
- Added getAvailableSpots to RegistrationService
- canChoose: counts AVAILABLE vs total slots
- non-canChoose: registrationMaximum minus RESERVED slots
- Added 8 unit tests covering both event types
Files: registration.repository.ts, registration.service.ts, registration.service.test.ts

PRD #2: Add available-spots endpoint to registration controller
- Added GET /registration/:eventId/available-spots to AdminRegistrationController
- Injects RegistrationService, calls getAvailableSpots method
- Returns { availableSpots, totalSpots }
- No controller tests (none exist in codebase); service tests already cover logic
Files: admin-registration.controller.ts

PRD #3: Add available-spots Next.js API route
- Created GET /api/registration/[eventId]/available-spots proxy route
- Uses fetchWithAuth pattern; proxies to NestJS /registration/{eventId}/available-spots
Files: apps/web/app/api/registration/[eventId]/available-spots/route.ts
