# PR Review Workflow

Execute these steps in order. Fix any issues before proceeding to the next step.

## Step 1: Read All Comments

Read the comments on the most recent open PR in github. Account for paging if there are a lot of comments.

## Step 2: Evaluate

Evaluate the comments and decide what issues should be addressed, what issues are incorrect,
and what comments can be ignored because they are not worth the effort.

## Step 3: Present a Plan

Present your findings to the user with an action plan.
